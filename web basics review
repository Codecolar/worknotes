HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages
HTML elements are represented by tags
Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page

The <head> element has nothing to do with HTML headings, <head> element contains meta information about
 the document
The following tags describe metadata: <title>, <style>, <meta>, <link>, <script>, and <base>.
The <title> element specifies a title for the document
The visible part of the HTML document is between <body> and </body>.

The <!DOCTYPE> declaration represents the document type, and helps browsers to display web pages correctly.

Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements.
Attributes: Single or Double Quotes?
-Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.

Spaces and lines: 
With HTML, you cannot change the output by adding extra spaces or extra lines in your HTML code.
The browser will remove any extra spaces and extra lines when the page is displayed
solution:
Text inside a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font (usually Courier), and it preserves
 both spaces and line breaks:

HTML styles:
<tagname style="property:value;">

--------- CSS ----------
CSS can be added to HTML elements in 3 ways:
-Inline - by using the style attribute in HTML elements
-Internal - by using a <style> element in the <head> section
-External - by using an external CSS file

Internal CSS:
<head>
<style>
body {background-color: powderblue;}
h1   {color: blue;}
p    {color: red;}
</style>
</head>

External CSS:
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>

CSS Padding:
The CSS padding property defines a padding (space) between the text and the border:
CSS Margin:
The CSS margin property defines a margin (space) outside the border:

The id Attribute:
<p id="p01">I am different</p>
#p01 {
    color: blue;
}

The class Attribute:
<p class="error">I am different</p>
p.error {
    color: red;
}

Links:
a:link visited hover active{} //pseudo-selector of CSS 
target attribute: _blank _self _parent _top framename

Default display value for every HTML element:
Every HTML element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is.
The default display value for most elements is block or inline.

Block-level Elements:
A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.

Inline Elements:
An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

HTML Grouping Tags
Tag	Description
<div>	Defines a section in a document (block-level)
<span>	Defines a section in a document (inline)

The class Attribute:
<style>
div.someclass {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
    margin: 20px 0 20px 0;
    padding: 20px;
} 
</style>
<div class="someclass"></div>

HTML Iframes:
An iframe is used to display a web page within a web page.
<iframe src="URL"></iframe>

HTML Layout Elements
Websites often display content in multiple columns (like a magazine or newspaper).

HTML5 offers new semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:
<header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
<nav> - Defines a container for navigation links
<section> - Defines a section in a document
<article> - Defines an independent self-contained article
<aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
<footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
<details> - Defines additional details
<summary> - Defines a heading for the <details> element

HTML Layout Techniques
There are four different ways to create multicolumn layouts. Each way has its pros and cons:
-HTML tables : Do NOT use tables for your page layout!
-CSS float property : It is common to do entire web layouts using the CSS float property. 
	Float is easy to learn - you just need to remember how the float and clear properties work. 
	Disadvantages: Floating elements are tied to the document flow, which may harm the flexibility.
-CSS framework : If you want to create your layout fast, you can use a framework, like Bootstrap.
-CSS flexbox : Flexbox is a new layout mode in CSS3.Use of flexbox ensures that elements behave predictably
	when the page layout must accommodate different screen sizes and different display devices. 
	Disadvantages: Does not work in IE10 and earlier.
	
HTML Responsive Web Design:
Responsive Web Design makes your web page look good on all devices, is about using CSS and HTML to resize, 
hide, shrink, enlarge, or move the content to make it look good on any screen:
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

HTML Computer Code Elements
Tag	Description
<code>	Defines programming code
<kbd>	Defines keyboard input 
<samp>	Defines computer output
<var>	Defines a variable
<pre>	Defines preformatted text

HTML Entities:
Reserved characters in HTML must be replaced with character entities.
Characters that are not present on your keyboard can also be replaced by entities.

HTML Encoding (Character Sets):
To display an HTML page correctly, a web browser must know which character set (character encoding) to use.
ASCII was the first character encoding standard (also called character set). ASCII defined 127 different alphanumeric 
characters that could be used on the internet: numbers (0-9), English letters (A-Z), and some special characters like 
! $ + - ( ) @ < > .
ANSI (Windows-1252) was the original Windows character set, with support for 256 different character codes.
ISO-8859-1 was the default character set for HTML 4. This character set also supported 256 different character codes.
Because ANSI and ISO-8859-1 were so limited, the default character encoding was changed to UTF-8 in HTML5.
UTF-8 (Unicode) covers almost all of the characters and symbols in the world.

URL Encoding:
URLs can only be sent over the Internet using the ASCII character-set. If a URL contains characters outside the ASCII
set, the URL has to be converted.
URL encoding converts non-ASCII characters into a format that can be transmitted over the Internet.
URL encoding replaces non-ASCII characters with a "%" followed by hexadecimal digits.
URLs cannot contain spaces. URL encoding normally replaces a space with a plus (+) sign, or %20.

HTML Forms:
HTML <form> element defines a form that is used to collect user input
The <input> element is the most important form element.
<input type="text">	    Defines a one-line text input field
<input type="radio">	Defines a radio button (for selecting one of many choices)
<input type="submit">	Defines a submit button (for submitting the form)
The Action Attribute:
<form action="/action_page.php">
The action attribute defines the action to be performed when the form is submitted.
If the action attribute is omitted, the action is set to the current page.
The Method Attribute:
The method attribute specifies the HTTP method (GET or POST) to be used when submitting the form data:
<form action="/action_page.php" method="get/post">
The default method when submitting form data is GET. when GET is used, the submitted form data will be
visible in the page address field:
Always use POST if the form data contains sensitive or personal information. The POST method does not
display the submitted form data in the page address field.
POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
The Name Attribute:
Each input field must have a name attribute to be submitted.
If the name attribute is omitted, the data of that input field will not be sent at all.

What is HTML Canvas?
The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.
The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.
Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100" style="border:1px solid #000000;">
</canvas>
var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
var img = document.getElementById("scream");
ctx.drawImage(img,10,10);

What is SVG?
SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics
SVG is used to define graphics for the Web
The HTML <svg> element is a container for SVG graphics.
SVG has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and graphic images.
<svg width="100" height="100">
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="green" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow" />
</svg>

HTML5 Video
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
