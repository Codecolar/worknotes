###Feature Highlights
Not only is Source Insight a great program editor, but it also can display reference trees, class inheritance diagrams, and call trees

Source Insight automatically builds and maintains its own high performance symbol database of functions, methods, global variables, structures, classes, and other types of symbols defined in your project source files.

####Symbol Windows For Each File
Symbol Windows appear on the side of each source window and are dynamically updated to allow easy navigation within each file and to provide a quick overview of the file.

####Context Window
Automatic Display of Declarations in the Context Window 
The Context Window also will automatically display files selected in the Project Window, symbols in the Relation Window, and clips selected in the Clip Window. 

####Relation Window
The Relation Window is a Source Insight innovation that shows interesting relationships between symbols. It runs in the background and tracks what symbols you have selected. With it, you can view class hierarchies, call trees, reference trees, and more.


The Relation Window can be viewed either graphically, or in outline format. You can also have several Relation Windows open, each showing different types of information. 

####Syntax Formatting
Syntax Formatting is an important Source Insight innovation that renders information in a dense, yet pleasing and useful way. It provides vastly improved display capabilities, including full rich text formatting with user-defined styles. Source Insight applies styles automatically based on lexical and symbolic information about your project.

references to local variables can look different from references to global variables. Or, references to functions can look different from references to C function-like macros.

####Smart Rename
Source Insight’s context-sensitive smart matching feature is smart enough to rename local scope variables, as well as global or class scope identifiers

####Keyword Searches Like an Internet Search on Your Code Base
For example, you might type “save disk (copy or duplicate)” and Source Insight will find all references to the words “save”, “disk”, and either “copy” or “duplicate” that occur near each other. See also “Search Project”.

####Symbolic Auto-Completion 
When you begin to type an identifier name, Source Insight will pop up a list of potential identifier names. Source Insight can show you function and variable names, as well as class and structure fields up to many levels of depth.
